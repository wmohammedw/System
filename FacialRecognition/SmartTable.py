        this is not the final version. we may add new methods if we need it.

    def __init__(self):
        '''
            You need to initilize the variables here before use them in the below methods.
            follow the OOP concepts.

            for example in model_training method:
                you will initilize the batch_size here:
                batch_size = 32

                and use it inside model_training method.
        '''
        pass

    def extract_faces(self):
        '''
            here you neet to write a function to extract the faces inide each image. you may use
            haar cascade or MTCNN (better) algorithms.

            you can add as many parameters you want.
        '''
        pass

    def loading_model(self):
        '''
            here you will load the trained model and use it in action.
        '''
        pass


    def bounded_box(self):
        '''
            here you want to show the bounded box around the face.

            you can add as many parameters you want.

        pass
